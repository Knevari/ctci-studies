List of algorithms and notes from Cracking the Coding Interview group study

## Folder Structure

Each data structure or algorithm folder contains a subfolder for each participant of the group study. You should pick only one programming language to solve all problems and stick to it. Keep your resolutions within your own folder and put a comment with name/nickname and date for every problem you solve.

## Commits Structure
Every commit should contain the name of the chapter, problem number and problem name along with your name within parentheses e.g. Trees and Graphs 4.4 - Check Balanced (Knevari)

## Plan Study
Every student will be given 1 week for each data structures and algorithms chapter. We should update this Github repo after every problem we solve as a way to document our progress. After every chapter end, we shall pick a medium/hard Leetcode problem of the same ds/algorithm category we studied and try to solve on our own without assistance. Good luck!
