# Arrays and Strings - Notes

This first chapter was quite a nice introduction to easy/medium algorithms. Most of this chapter's problems
were very easy to solve, but I still feel like I was able to learn a lot by being able to refresh some of these old concepts
in my mind. It feels like most problems in this chapter were focused on showing us the idea of using multiple pointers
to move things around arrays, strings and matrices. It has also shown that hash tables are often very useful
for keeping count of things and positions we can reference later in little to no overhead because of constant time access.

## Analyzing Average Time Complexity

### Arrays

- Access: O(1)
- Search: O(N)
- Insertion: O(N)
- Deletion: O(N)

### Hash Tables

- Access: O(1)
- Search: O(1)
- Insertion: O(1)
- Deletion: O(1)
